Resource Hacker™ - Version 4.0

2 May 2015
Copyright 1999-2015 Angus Johnson

http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker

FREEWARE utility to view, modify, add, rename 
and delete resources in Windows executables and
resource files. Incorporates an internal 
resource compiler and decompiler. 

----------------------------------------------
Summary:
----------------------------------------------

Resource Hacker™ has been designed to:

1. View resources in executable files 
(*.exe, *.dll, *.cpl, *.ocx) and in Win32 
resource files (*.res) in both their compiled 
and decompiled formats.

2. Extract (save) resources to file in: 
*.res format; as a binary; or as decompiled 
resource scripts or images. 
Icons, bitmaps, cursors, menus, dialogs, 
string tables, message tables, accelerators, 
Borland forms and version info resources can 
be fully decompiled into their respective 
formats, whether as image files or  *.rc text 
files.

3. Modify (rename or replace) resources in 
executables. Image resources (icons, cursors 
and bitmaps) can be replaced with an image from 
a corresponding image file (*.ico, *.cur, *.bmp), 
a *.res file or even another *.exe file. 
Dialogs, menus, stringtables, accelerators and 
messagetable resource scripts (and also Borland 
forms) can be edited and recompiled using the 
internal resource script editor.
Resources can also be replaced with resources 
from a *.res file as long as the replacement 
resource is of the same type and has the same 
name.

4. Add new resources to executables.
Enable a program to support multiple languages, 
or add a custom icon or bitmap (company logo 
etc) to a program's dialog.

5. Delete resources. 
Most compilers add resources into applications 
which are never used by the application. 
Removing these unused resources can reduce an 
application's size.
